Pet adoption is a compassionate and rewarding act, yet the traditional process of finding 
the right pet can often be time-consuming, unstructured, and emotionally overwhelming.

project aims to modernize and simplify the pet adoption experience.Pawfect Match is a 
web-based application designed to bridge the gap between animal shelters and potential 
adopters through a user-friendly, intelligent matchmaking platform. Inspired by the 
structure of popular dating apps, the platform allows users to create personal profiles, 
specify preferences, and discover pets that best match their lifestyle, personality, and 
environment.By combining modern web development technologies such as React, 
TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Drizzle ORM, the project delivers a responsive and 
scalable solution that benefits both users and pet shelters. The application not only 
enhances visibility for adoptable pets but also encourages responsible pet ownership by 
making the adoption journey more intuitive and informed.
